# Sound Files

This directory contains sound files used in the DCMS application.

- `incoming-call.mp3`: Ringtone for incoming calls

Note: Since we can't directly create binary files, you'll need to add an actual MP3 file for the ringtone. You can use any standard ringtone sound file and name it `incoming-call.mp3`.
