This is a placeholder for the incoming-call.mp3 file.

To complete the implementation, you'll need to add an actual MP3 file named "incoming-call.mp3" to this directory.

You can use any standard ringtone sound file (typically 2-5 seconds long) that would be appropriate for an incoming call notification.

Free ringtones can be found on various websites, or you can create your own using audio editing software.

Once you've added the MP3 file, the SIP service will automatically use it to play a sound when there's an incoming call.
